Recently I saw this on twitter:

As you can see, I am (actually was) a Blue Archive player.

I wrote an article [*How a former FGO player plays Blue Archive*](/blog/how-fgo-player-plays-ba) which said:

> after I had played Blue Archive for a year, when the game finally passed CCP’s examination and launched in China, it underwent substantial changes due to ideological and political reasons that made it nearly unrecognizable.

Well, for most normal people, this racialization issue should be crazy and ridiculous. But for me, this kind of situation was bound to happen someday.

And as I said in that article:

> it might have potential to achieve a historic status comparable to the Touhou Project, had Nexon not mishandled their employee relations, which led to the departure of key creative team members.

Blue Archive is going downhill because of the departure of key creative team members. As someone who has read many light novels, at least for me, the downward trend in story quality is obvious. Because I'm busy with my business and the game became less interesting, I eventually abandoned it.

## The Leader: Chauvinism

Back to the topic, what's wrong with Chinese's ideology?

First, **those Chinese who is reading this blog with translation software, get outta here!**

Ok, now we can discuss rationally and peacefully.

This drama reveals what chauvinism truly is and how deeply it runs within certain Chinese communities. With chauvinism comes a fundamental inability to engage in rational and peaceful discussion. Their nationalistic pride prevents them from seeing other perspectives or acknowledging any criticism, no matter how valid.

This mindset is precisely why many refuse to learn English or other foreign languages. Their chauvinism convinces them that Chinese is superior and sufficient, that engaging with the outside world on its terms is beneath them. Why learn another language when yours is "the best"? Why consider other viewpoints when yours is "the only correct one"?

This language barrier isn't just about communication—it's about willful isolation. And the barrier is not just in language but extends to the entire internet. In case you don't know, they have the Great Firewall (GFW) to prevent themselves from accessing the international internet.

Look at how confused the African man is in the video. He didn't believe these horrific racist words could actually form a sentence and didn't understand why she would say that. He was so confused that he asked, "I don't think you understand what you say. Do you speak English?" This reveals he probably would never hear such language anywhere else except China.

This isn't just ignorance—it's the direct result of an ideology that promotes superiority and discourages genuine cross-cultural understanding. Her racist comments demonstrate a profound lack of self-awareness and an inability to see people from other cultures as equals.

Some people think it's the CCP that made them this way. This is partly true because the CCP needs them to remain isolated from outside perspectives to maintain governmental stability. But the disturbing question is: did the CCP make them chauvinistic, or does their chauvinism make it possible for the CCP to maintain power? According to Chinese history, Chinese society had already developed strong chauvinistic tendencies long before the word "chauvinism" was even invented.

But, there are indeed some ideological problems that were deliberately created and amplified by the CCP.

## Hide the Elephant in the Room: Weaponized Feminism

You can see some comments in Chinese under tweets about this matter like "*It's weaponized feminism's fault.*" or "*Typical woman*". I mean, no more obvious, this is not feminism's fault, and man could also do that. So why do they think like that?

The answer lies in how the CCP has deliberately engineered gender-based confrontation as a distraction strategy. By pitting men against women, they effectively redirect public attention away from the real elephant in the room: autocracy and the lack of fundamental rights. It's a classic divide-and-conquer approach that keeps citizens fighting each other instead of questioning the system that oppresses them all.

The implementation of this strategy is twofold. First, they manipulate public opinion through state-controlled media and online influencers who promote gender antagonism. Second, they employ selective enforcement of regulations - cracking down on genuine feminist movements while giving women a decided advantage in public opinion spheres. This isn't about supporting women's rights, but rather embedding an altered version of feminism that serves their control purposes.

True feminism would inevitably raise awareness about human rights in general. After all, women's rights are human rights, and once people start thinking critically about one form of inequality, they might begin questioning others. This is precisely what the CCP fears. So instead, they've carefully cultivated a distorted version of "feminism" to develop in China - one that's intentionally bad-faith, weaponized, and designed to create gender division rather than meaningful dialogue. This altered feminism appears to advance women's interests on the surface, but actually serves to prevent unity among citizens.

This artificially created conflict has begun to spiral out of control in recent years. We've seen horrifying consequences like the [Zhuhai Car Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Zhuhai_car_attack) and the [Suicide of Fat Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Fat_Cat) in November 2024. These tragedies are the direct result of intensified gender antagonism that has been allowed - even encouraged - to fester.

So when Chinese netizens blame "weaponized feminism" for the racist behavior of the Blue Archive cosplayer, they're unknowingly participating in exactly the kind of misdirected blame that the system has conditioned them to engage in. They've been trained to see social problems through the lens of gender conflict rather than identifying the actual systemic issues at play.

The irony is that both the misogynistic backlash against "feminism" and the toxic version of "feminism" that exists in China are two sides of the same coin - both are products of deliberate ideological manipulation that serves to distract from genuine political discourse. Meanwhile, actual feminist principles of equality and human dignity are suppressed because they pose a real threat to authoritarian control.

## A Four Quadrants: Giga-Escapism, Social Darwinism, Escapism, and Numbness

![Analysis of China's current social mentality](https://imagedelivery.net/6gszw1iux5BH0bnwjXECTQ/6eb578a3-1a04-447e-721f-25371c99ce00/small)

Here is a figure titled "Analysis of China's current social mentality". These four character are:

|        |uncooperative|cooperative|
|--------|-------------|-----------|
|positive|giga-escapism(润)|social darwinism(卷)|
|negative|escapism(躺)|numbness(韭)|

Because of the peculiarities of the Chinese, there is no way to find an exact translation of these four words. But the basic idea is:

- giga-escapism(润): Taking positive action to escape from China and seek to emigrate to other countries.
- social darwinism(卷): Compete aggressively for social status and resources. Believe winner will be better.
- escapism(躺): Abandon goals and high-level demand. Trying to escape from huge stress.
- numbness(韭): Accept the status quo and numbness.
