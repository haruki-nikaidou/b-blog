Recently, I came across this post on Twitter:

As you can tell, I was once a Blue Archive player. I previously wrote about this in an article titled [*How a former FGO player plays Blue Archive*](https://blog.plr.moe/blog/how-fgo-player-plays-ba), where I noted:

> after I had played Blue Archive for a year, when the game finally passed CCP’s examination and launched in China, it underwent substantial changes due to ideological and political reasons that made it nearly unrecognizable.

To most observers, the racialization controversy surrounding the game might seem absurd. But to me, it was inevitable.

And as I said in that article:

> it might have potential to achieve a historic status comparable to the Touhou Project, had Nexon not mishandled their employee relations, which led to the departure of key creative team members.

The decline in narrative quality following their departure is obvious, especially for those familiar with Japanese light novels like me. Coupled with my increasing professional commitments and dwindling interest, I ultimately stopped playing.

## The Root: Chauvinism

Back to the main topic: what's wrong with Chinese ideology?

First, **those Chinese who is reading this blog with translation software, get outta here!**

Ok, now we can discuss rationally and peacefully.

This drama reveals what chauvinism truly is and how deeply it runs within certain Chinese communities. With chauvinism comes a fundamental inability to engage in rational and peaceful discussion. Their nationalistic pride prevents them from seeing other perspectives or acknowledging any criticism, no matter how valid.

This mindset is precisely why many refuse to learn English or other foreign languages. Their chauvinism convinces them that Chinese is superior and sufficient, that engaging with the outside world on its terms is beneath them. Why learn another language when yours is "the best"? Why consider other viewpoints when yours is "the only correct one"?

This language barrier isn't just about communication—it's about willful isolation. And the barrier is not just in language but extends to the entire internet. In case you don't know, they have the Great Firewall (GFW) to prevent themselves from accessing the international internet.

Look at how confused the African man is in the video. He didn't believe these horrific racist words could actually form a sentence and didn't understand why she would say that. He was so confused that he asked, "I don't think you understand what you say. Do you speak English?" This reveals he probably would never hear such language anywhere else except China.

This isn't just ignorance—it's the direct result of an ideology that promotes superiority and discourages genuine cross-cultural understanding. Her racist comments demonstrate a profound lack of self-awareness and an inability to see people from other cultures as equals.

Some people think it's the CCP that made them this way. This is partly true because the CCP needs them to remain isolated from outside perspectives to maintain governmental stability. But the disturbing question is: did the CCP make them chauvinistic, or does their chauvinism make it possible for the CCP to maintain power? According to Chinese history, Chinese society had already developed strong chauvinistic tendencies long before the word "chauvinism" was even invented.

But, there are indeed some ideological problems that were deliberately created and amplified by the CCP.

## Hide the Elephant in the Room: Weaponized Feminism

You can see some comments in Chinese under tweets about this matter like "*It's weaponized feminism's fault.*" or "*Typical woman*". I mean, no more obvious, this is not feminism's fault, and man could also do that. So why do they think like that?

The answer lies in how the CCP has deliberately engineered gender-based confrontation as a distraction strategy. By pitting men against women, they effectively redirect public attention away from the real elephant in the room: autocracy and the lack of fundamental rights. It's a classic divide-and-conquer approach that keeps citizens fighting each other instead of questioning the system that oppresses them all.

The implementation of this strategy is twofold. First, they manipulate public opinion through state-controlled media and online influencers who promote gender antagonism. Second, they employ selective enforcement of regulations - cracking down on genuine feminist movements while giving women a decided advantage in public opinion spheres. This isn't about supporting women's rights, but rather embedding an altered version of feminism that serves their control purposes.

> According to the China's criminal law, a woman rape a young boy is not a crime. And if the woman gets pregnant, the boy's family has to pay for the child, or the boy is guilty because of abandonment if the boy is over 14 years old.
>
> The reason is, China's Criminal Law defines rape only as "a man forcing a woman," excluding "a woman forcing a man."
>
> This loophole has been around for a long time. But it just recently drew attention during cases where female middle school teachers sexually abused male students.

> An ironic aspect of this situation is that one reason the CCP can give women a decided advantage in justice and enforcement stems from existing gender bigotry.
>
> In China's courts and prosecutor's offices, women significantly outnumber men, making it easier to implement selective enforcement of laws. However, this gender imbalance exists primarily because girls are often steered away from STEM fields based on the sexist belief that they aren't "smart enough" to be engineers or scientists. Instead, they're pressured toward legal professions, which are paradoxically considered "lesser" career paths by many men. Thus, the very bigotry that undermines women in some fields inadvertently concentrates them in positions that can be leveraged for ideological control.

True feminism would inevitably raise awareness about human rights in general. After all, women's rights are human rights, and once people start thinking critically about one form of inequality, they might begin questioning others. This is precisely what the CCP fears. So instead, they've carefully cultivated a distorted version of "feminism" to develop in China - one that's intentionally bad-faith, weaponized, and designed to create gender division rather than meaningful dialogue. This altered feminism appears to advance women's interests on the surface, but actually serves to prevent unity among citizens.

> A piece of evidence that China's justice doesn't actually protect women's human right is [Xuzhou chained woman incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuzhou_chained_woman_incident), where an unlawfully imprisoned woman who was chained to a wall and birthed 8 children. After this is revealed by social media, China government tried to delete all source as fast as possible. Even eventually the incident was reported to international media, the Chinese government still tried to suppress it. By the way, the 8 children's father is not accused of rape.

This artificially created conflict has begun to spiral out of control in recent years. We've seen horrifying consequences like the [Zhuhai Car Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Zhuhai_car_attack) and the [Suicide of Fat Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Fat_Cat) in November 2024. These tragedies are the direct result of intensified gender antagonism that has been allowed - even encouraged - to fester.

So when Chinese netizens blame "weaponized feminism" for the racist behavior of the Blue Archive cosplayer, they're unknowingly participating in exactly the kind of misdirected blame that the system has conditioned them to engage in. They've been trained to see social problems through the lens of gender conflict rather than identifying the actual systemic issues at play.

The irony is that both the misogynistic backlash against "feminism" and the toxic version of "feminism" that exists in China are two sides of the same coin - both are products of deliberate ideological manipulation that serves to distract from genuine political discourse. Meanwhile, actual feminist principles of equality and human dignity are suppressed because they pose a real threat to authoritarian control.

## When Inhibition Goes Crazy: Decentralized Spontaneous Detonation

Because Chinese society is not totally isolated like North Korea, inhibition has a somewhat powerful effect. In the past, this manifested in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. More recently, we saw the [White Paper Protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_COVID-19_protests_in_China). However, as the pace of economic growth slows down and more people start feeling hopeless, this inhibition can take on increasingly extreme forms.

Here is an interesting figure from a stock company presentation:

![Analysis of China's current social mentality](https://imagedelivery.net/6gszw1iux5BH0bnwjXECTQ/6eb578a3-1a04-447e-721f-25371c99ce00/small)

The title of this figure is "Analysis of China's current social mentality". These four characters represent different social attitudes:

|        |uncooperative|cooperative|
|--------|-------------|-----------|
|positive|giga-escapism(润)|social darwinism(卷)|
|negative|escapism(躺)|numbness(韭)|

Due to the linguistic and cultural specificities of Chinese, there's no exact translation for these four terms. But the basic concepts are:

- **Giga-escapism (润)**: Taking positive action to escape from China and emigrate to other countries.
- **Social Darwinism (卷)**: Competing aggressively for social status and resources. Believing winners deserve their success.
- **Escapism (躺)**: Abandoning goals and higher-level demands. Trying to escape from enormous social pressure.
- **Numbness (韭)**: Accepting the status quo with emotional numbness.

It's reasonable to guess that one's level of wealth and awareness determine their mentality. We can conclude that those in the Social Darwinism (卷) quadrant are typically the most chauvinistic, with the Numbness (韭) group following closely behind. The Giga-escapism (润) and Escapism (躺) groups tend to be less chauvinistic because they recognize the need to be uncooperative with the system.

However, the truly concerning aspect isn't captured in this matrix.

A few days later, someone added a Z-axis to this matrix:

![The figure with Z axis](https://imagedelivery.net/6gszw1iux5BH0bnwjXECTQ/dca7681e-7da3-4586-d733-6236cbc2fb00/public)

The top position is labeled 献 (Killing), and the bottom is 摘 (Sacrificed).

Let's start with the less extreme dimension. The term 摘 (Sacrificed) refers to being sacrificed by the CCP. This term originated from rumors that the CCP harvests organs from young people. "摘" means "to pick" or "to harvest," and in this context, it refers to organs being harvested. While this sounds outlandish, there have been some medical research papers with unclear organ sources and suspicious murder cases where victims' organs disappeared, giving the rumor a veneer of plausibility. In this expanded chart, 摘 has been broadened to mean being sacrificed by the CCP through any destructive policy.

But if organ harvesting rumors aren't considered the most extreme aspect, what is?

The top position, 献 (Killing), represents something far more disturbing. The concept isn't just about killing—it embodies a nihilistic response to hopelessness. The idea is that when individuals feel completely hopeless, they may choose to kill as many people as possible or, if unable to harm others, kill themselves. The underlying belief is that these acts of violence will frighten the broader population, force societal reflection, and ultimately generate enough public pressure to force the CCP to change.

This is what I call "decentralized spontaneous detonation"—a twisted manifestation of extreme inhibition against the ruling system.

The effectiveness of this approach has been grimly demonstrated by waves of student suicides that have forced schools to provide rest periods that students should have received as a matter of course.

> According to [611study.icu](https://611study.icu/), the standard schedule for Chinese middle and high school students is grueling: arriving at school by 6:00 a.m. and not being dismissed until 11:00 p.m., with classes running 6 or 7 days per week.
> 
> The 611study project aims to ensure reasonable rest periods for students, primarily through online awareness campaigns. While it has successfully raised awareness about these extreme conditions, it has made little concrete progress. Students in the most oppressive educational environments often cannot even access the internet, making it impossible to hear their voices. Moreover, the very existence of such a project highlights the absence of legitimate channels for addressing these issues—if proper outlets existed, such desperate measures wouldn't be necessary in the first place.

Unlike traditional centralized movements where authorities can target leaders and predict developments, this phenomenon is random and decentralized. No one knows who might initiate violence or when it might occur—sometimes not even the perpetrators themselves until they act. Its frightening effectiveness comes from the fact that, unlike conventional movements requiring mass gatherings to create influence, just a few random violent incidents can make everyone fear they'll be next.

This represents the darkest extreme of societal pressure in a system that provides no legitimate outlets for grievances and no hope for meaningful change through conventional means.

## Epilogue

That's what's happening in China.

The cosplayer thought those horrific racist words were just a joke. 

Meanwhile, their chauvinism drove them to frame an innocent Japanese Blue Archive cosplayer.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hwAnZ89RPL">pic.twitter.com/hwAnZ89RPL</a></p>&mdash; ちず🧀Chizu (@ChizuCheese8) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChizuCheese8/status/1906807913001386205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 31, 2025</a></blockquote>

Because of the backlash stemming from weaponized feminism, they investigated and made public the Chinese cosplayer's personal information—data collected and leaked by the government. Yet they remain unable to identify the true problem, exactly as the government intends.

![The personal information of the Chinese coser](https://imagedelivery.net/6gszw1iux5BH0bnwjXECTQ/cff7582d-ba0a-4f15-7499-6441f472ae00/public)

> - "Anime expert"
> - Red Book & Weibo user
> - Explicitly labeled as "Weaponized feminist"

Nobody knows how to solve these deeply entrenched problems. Even worse, the CCP is waiting for an opportunity to export these ideological issues to the rest of the world.

Thankfully, you weren't born in China—or even if you were, you're smart enough to understand this article and see beyond the manufactured divisions.
