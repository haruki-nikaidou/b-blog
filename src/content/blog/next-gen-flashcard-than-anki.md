## The Blind Spots in Self-Learning Apps

Self-learning apps like Anki and Supermemo are popular, but have you noticed how often they're geared towards language learning? 

Developers and fans love to tout their "innovations" and "efficiency", claiming they're faster than university courses, accelerate memorization, and use cognitive psychology to ensure you never forget. The truth is, that's only true if you use them correctly. If you're new to Anki, downloading pre-made decks is a common mistake. Doing this while learning a language often leads to wasted time memorizing irrelevant vocabulary. You might even find yourself wondering why others, who don't obsess over perfect recall, can use the language more effectively.

The biggest issue with these apps is that while they're great for reviewing, they don't help you figure out **what** to learn. Even worse, they're so effective at memorization that they can discourage deeper understanding and application.

Imagine you're an archaeology student needing to learn definite integrals because required. Would you dive into Lebesgue integrals? Probably not.

A similar, less obvious issue often gets overlooked. Think of Americans who can speak fluently despite spelling errors. If you're learning Japanese solely to enjoy anime, would you spend time mastering the writing of complex Kanji like 魑魅魍魎?

These examples highlight the challenge of controlling *what* you learn. It's difficult for non-experts to create perfect decks. So, what about relying on expert-created decks?

Another issue is that these apps can't ensure a logical learning order. For structured knowledge, like calculus, you need complete comprehension before creating your **review** deck. Using pre-made decks is ineffective and painful because you lack the necessary context. This limitation explains why these apps are often favored for language learning, where the order of vocabulary acquisition is less critical.

There are also some issues impossible to solve. 

The material you learn, and how it's presented, dictates your proficiency, especially with skills. You can't learn to swim with flashcards. While that sounds ridiculous, consider why some language learners who *don't* obsess over perfect recall are more effective. Many Anki users, despite knowing better, ignore [second-language acquisition theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-language_acquisition) (which they probably know) and rely solely on vocabulary memorization. Both scenarios are equally misguided.
