The pure love ("純愛" in Japanese), as the term literally suggests, means nature, altruistic, equal, non-coercive, non-purposeful love. The pure love genres, especially for novels, films and television dramas, was bloomed in early 2000s in Japan. It had emerged alongside the collapse of Japan's economic bubble, being used by writers and playwrights against consumerism and capitalism. As Japan's economy recovered and generations changed, it gradually evolved from a mean of opposing the consumerism society into a regular goal to be achieved. Nowadays, it has become the mainstream among romance light novels, manga, and other kinds of works, playing a part in various other works where romance is not the primary theme.

## The Sufficient Conditions of Pure Love

In contemporary (after Suzumiya Haruhi) works, the sufficient and necessary conditions can be almost entirely covered by the union of the following four conditions, each of which is a sufficient condition.

- Type I: duck test
- Type II: allies
- Type III: asymmetric and optimization
- Type IV: destiny

### The Beforehand: Economy Concern

These 4 conditions are so good that you can even try to implement the pure love in real life with them. However, I have to mention that unlike virtual characters whose economy condition are generally ignored by authors on purpose, you must concern about your economy condition.

In light novel and manga, the authors can avoid talking about the economy concern by:

1. Set the characters to be student, who never need to think about how to make money.
2. Set the characters to be in a fantastic world, where they don't need much money to live.
3. Set the characters to be in a wealthy family, where they have technically enough money to use.
4. Just pretend it didn't need to be worried anyway.
