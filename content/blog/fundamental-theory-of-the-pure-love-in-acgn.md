Pure love ("純愛" or *jun'ai* in Japanese) refers to love that is natural, altruistic, equal, non-coercive, and free from ulterior motives. As a literary and cinematic genre, pure love works flourished in early 2000s Japan, emerging against the backdrop of the country's economic bubble collapse. Writers and creators wielded the genre as a form of cultural resistance against the encroaching forces of consumerism and capitalism that had defined the bubble era.

However, as Japan's economy stabilized and generational attitudes shifted, pure love underwent a significant transformation. What began as an oppositional framework, a critique of commodified relationships and transactional social values, gradually evolved into an aspirational ideal in its own right. Today, pure love has become a dominant aesthetic within romance light novels, manga, and anime. Its influence extends beyond dedicated romance narratives, functioning as a recurring motif in works across genres where romantic elements serve supporting rather than primary roles.

## The Sufficient Conditions of Pure Love

In contemporary (after Suzumiya Haruhi) works, the sufficient and necessary conditions can be almost entirely covered by the union of the following four conditions, each of which is a sufficient condition.

- Type I: duck test
- Type II: allies
- Type III: asymmetric and optimization
- Type IV: destiny

### The Beforehand: Economy Concern

These 4 conditions are so good that you can even try to implement the pure love in real life with them. However, I have to mention that unlike virtual characters whose economy condition are generally ignored by authors on purpose, you must concern about your economy condition.

In light novel and manga, the authors can avoid talking about the economy concern by:

1. Set the characters to be student, who never need to think about how to make money.
2. Set the characters to be in a fantastic world, where they don't need much money to live.
3. Set the characters to be in a wealthy family, where they have technically enough money to use.
4. Just pretend it didn't need to be worried anyway.
